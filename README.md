# Introduction-to-OpenGL
A project I did at the beginning of the Introduction to Computer Graphics course I took at the beginning of sophomore year. It wasn't until the summer of 2015 when I had time to waste that I actually improved my coding style, so this looks pretty bad compared to code I write currently. The project creates a rotating cube on a window.
